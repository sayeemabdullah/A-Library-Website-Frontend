# A Library Website

## Frontend:

#### I used React.js to design the frontend and then connect with the [backend APIs](https://github.com/sayeemabdullah/A-Library-Website).

#### Run the Backend and Frontend:

First you have to run the [backend](https://github.com/sayeemabdullah/A-Library-Website) with **py api.py** and the frontend with **npm start**.
