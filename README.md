# A Library Website

## Frontend:

#### I used React.js for the very first time to design the frontend and then connect with the [backend APIs](https://github.com/sayeemabdullah/A-Library-Website).

#### Run the Backend and Frontend:

You have to run the [backend](https://github.com/sayeemabdullah/A-Library-Website) with **python api.py** and the frontend with **npm start**.

#### Users & User Interface (UI):

**Two types of users :**

1. Admin user
2. General user 

**The User Interface (UI) :**

The above figure is of the **login page**. If you don't have an account you can simply click on **Don't have an account? Go to Registration** which will take you to the below page.

You can register as only general user and then can be upgraded to **Admin** from backend. If you already have an account you can click on **Already have an account? Go to login** and login with your **username** and **password**.

##### If you want to login as Admin use "ADMIN" or "INTERCLOUD" as username/name and "admin" as password.

After you are logged in you can see the list of all the books in the library and if you are **a general user or an admin** you can use the **Add to Wishlist** button to add the book to your wishlist. If you are **an Admin** then only you can use the **Delete Book** and **Edit Book** button to delete book or else the button won't work.

After clicking **Edit Book**, the above page will apear and will automatically fetch the data and you can edit accordingly if you are an **Admin**.

After adding to your wishlist you can see your book list here and can also remove by clicking **Remove from Wishlist**.

**Add Book** page is for **Admin Only** but if you are general user you can visit the page and try to add books but unfortunately you cannot.

And something I almost forgot to mention if you are not logged inyou cannot go to any other tabs/pages. If you try to you will get a message shown in the below figure.

And you can click on **Logout** to logout.
